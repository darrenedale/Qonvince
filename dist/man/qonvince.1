.SH NAME
qonvince \- A qt-based application for generating OTP codes (TOTP)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qonvince
.SH DESCRIPTION
Qonvince works as a single point of reference for all your two-factor
authentication codes using the TOTP algorithm. Like Google Authenticator,
it is set up with the TOTP definition (usually just the shared secret, but
all TOTP parameters can be adjusted) and it will continuously generate and
display your one-time codes for authentication with your services. It uses
Qt5 to provide a simple and comfortable user interface.
.SH ARGUMENTS
There are currently no command-line arguments.
.SH FILES
.I ~/.conf/Ã‰quit/Qonvice/QOnvince.ini
.RS
The file that stores the configuration for your OTP codes. The secret for
each configured service is stored in this file in an encrypted form. The
encryption is not particularly strong, but should protect against idle
snoopers.
.RE
.SH BUGS
Qonvince currently has no known bugs. It is currently in active development
and has planned new features.
